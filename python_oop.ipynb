    "### Why is OOP Useful?\n",

    "OOP is useful for the same reason that abstraction is useful: for recognizing and exploiting the common structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "- *a Markov chain* consists of a set of states, an initial probability distribution over states,  and a collection of probabilities of moving across states  \n",
    "- *a general equilibrium theory* consists of a commodity space, preferences, technologies, and an equilibrium definition  \n",
    "- *a game* consists of a list of players, lists of actions available to each player, each player’s payoffs as functions of all other players’ actions, and a timing protocol  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all abstractions that collect together “objects” of the same “type”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognizing common structure allows us to employ common tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "In economic theory, this might be a proposition that applies to all games of a certain type.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, this might be a method that’s useful for all Markov chains (e.g., `simulate`).\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use OOP, the `simulate` method is conveniently bundled together with the Markov chain object."
