    "- the huge range of high quality scientific libraries,  \n",

    "Another is that pure Python, while flexible and elegant, is not fast.\n",

    "So we need libraries that are designed to accelerate execution of Python code.\n",

    "1. using compilers that convert Python-like statements into fast machine code for individual threads of logic and  \n",
    "1. parallelizing tasks across multiple “workers” (e.g., CPUs, individual threads inside GPUs).  \n",

    "On the other hand, high-level languages are harder to optimize — that is, to turn into fast machine code — than languages like C or Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the standard implementation of Python (called CPython) cannot match the speed of compiled languages such as C or Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does that mean that we should just switch to C or Fortran for everything?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is: No!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three reasons why:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, for any given program, relatively few lines are ever going to be time-critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence it is far more efficient to write most of our code in a high productivity language like Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, even for those lines of code that *are* time-critical, we can now achieve the same speed as C or Fortran using Python’s scientific libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, in the last few years, accelerating code has become essentially\n",
    "synonymous with parallelizing execution, and this task is best left to\n",
    "specialized compilers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain Python libraries have outstanding capabilities for parallelizing\n",
