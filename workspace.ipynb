    "Text files and scripts allow for long pieces of code to be written and executed in a single go.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore the use of Python scripts as an alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Lab and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) development environments are then introduced along with a primer on version control (Git).\n",

    "In this lecture, you will learn to\n",
